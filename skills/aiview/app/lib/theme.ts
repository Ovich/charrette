// Forcing a mockup's colour scheme from the viewer.
//
// The frame is sandboxed with an opaque origin, so the viewer cannot reach into its
// document and flip a class. It cannot change `prefers-color-scheme` either: that follows
// the reader's own machine, and no API overrides it for an embedded document.
//
// So the served html is rewritten instead, and the rewrite is on the MEDIA CONDITION
// rather than on the rules inside it: `(prefers-color-scheme: dark)` becomes a condition
// that is always true, or one that is never true. This works on every mockup ever written,
// including the ones that predate any convention, because a mockup that supports a dark
// theme at all expresses it that way. `(prefers-color-scheme: light)` is inverted with it,
// for the files that write both.
//
// `data-theme` is set on the root as well, for mockups that also offer their own switch
// (`:root[data-theme="dark"]`). Setting both means the viewer's choice wins whichever
// convention the file follows, and the two never disagree.
