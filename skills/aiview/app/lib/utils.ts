/**
 * The colour of a kind chip.
 *
 * It used to be a hash of the name, which is deterministic and useless: `plan` 97,
 * `reference` 107, `architecture` 115 and `roadmap` 116 all landed inside twenty degrees
 * of the same green, and `spec` 187 and `report` 188 were one degree apart. A person
 * reading a sidebar of a dozen documents could not tell a plan from a roadmap by colour,
 * which is the only thing the chip is for.
 *
 * Even spacing was the second attempt, eleven hues 33 degrees apart, and it failed at
 * the chip's own lightness: at 94% every hue is pastel, and three greens, two blues and
 * two purples sat side by side in the sidebar indistinguishable. Hue alone cannot carry
 * thirteen kinds.
 *
 * So each kind has two channels. Its hue, one of eleven named colours a reader can call
 * out (red, orange, amber, lime, green, teal, blue, indigo, violet, purple, magenta),
 * and its tone: `strong` fills the chip, `light` tints it. Neighbours on the wheel
 * alternate tone, so two kinds one spoke apart never share both. Pairs that appear
 * together are pushed apart in hue as well: a plan beside its slices and its
 * verifications, a board beside its spec, a roadmap beside its reference, the feature
 * map beside its verifications. `pdf` is a foreign format and takes the one grey.
 *
 * A kind not listed here still gets a stable colour from the old hash, moved off the
 * spokes above so a new kind cannot be born looking like an existing one.
