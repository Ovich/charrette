// SSE client registry for /events, with a heartbeat.
//
// A silent stream cannot be told from a dead one. A socket can break without a FIN — a
// machine that slept, an embedded browser (the viewer runs in VS Code's Simple Browser
// as often as in a real tab) — and then nobody notices: the server keeps writing into a
// client no one reads, and the tab's EventSource fires no error, so it never reconnects.
// The sidebar says "live" while the document on screen is hours old, until a manual
// refresh (2026-09-18). The heartbeat is what makes both ends notice: a write that fails
// prunes the client here, and a tab that hears nothing for several beats reconnects
// there (app/hooks/useDocuments.ts). It is a `ping` event rather than an SSE comment so
// the tab's watchdog can see it — a comment frame never reaches `onmessage`.
