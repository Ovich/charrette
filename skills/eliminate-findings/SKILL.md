name: eliminate-findings
description: Use when the same remark keeps being made in a repository's pull request reviews, or when someone asks what the reviews keep catching and how to stop catching it. Groups the comment history into recurring findings and decides, for each, the rung that removes it: a design that makes it impossible, a lint or type rule, a test in CI, a convention, a fix to the skill that produced the code. Produces a report in aiview with a recommendation per finding, applied on a yes. Not for reviewing one pull request (pr-review) and not for writing a rule already decided (project-conventions).

# Eliminate findings

**A review comment made twice is a finding about the process**: something upstream, a design, a tool, a test, a rule, a brief, let it reach a human. Find the rung where it stops.

## Read the history

1. **Run `scripts/comments.mjs <owner/repo>`** for the thread openers: every review comment by a person, bots excluded, replies excluded, with its pull request, path, date and body. `--since <ISO>` after an earlier run, `--json` to parse.
2. **The person's own words are the signal.** A bot's comment counts as a second source, never as the finding. A reply that says "done" and cites a commit is the evidence of what the fix was: read it for the shape the person accepted.
3. **Read the reports of `pr-review`** in aiview (`list --kind report`) for the findings the agent raised itself, and the conventions file for the rules that already exist: a finding a rule already covers is a finding about the rule, its wording, its cost line, or its enforcement.

## Group

- **A finding is one thing the person wanted done differently**, named in their words, however many files and pull requests it spans. "One service owns the current user", "the mock is a module, not a branch in the client", "a primitive stays in `ui/`, business logic leaves it".
- **Two occurrences is a candidate, three is overdue.** One occurrence stays a comment, unless the person's reply said "that is now the rule": then it is a decision already made and the question is only its rung.
- **Count what it cost**: the occurrences, the pull requests, the rework commits each one caused.
- **A comment whose answer was "no, and here is why"** is not a finding. Drop it, and say so in the report: the person may want a rule saying why.

## Choose the rung

**Read `references/ladder.md` before choosing**: the rungs in order of preference, the criterion that admits a finding to each, the artefact each produces. The highest rung the finding admits wins: every rung below it leaves a human to catch it again. A finding may take two rungs, the design change that removes its class and the test that keeps it removed.

## The report

**One `report` document, opened in aiview when the reading starts**: kind `report` from the filename `YYYY-MM-DD-review-findings.report.md`, tags = project + `review-findings`, started when the reading began. Tell the person the URL.

Per finding, a section: the person's words, the occurrences linked, the cost, the rung with its criterion met, the artefact drafted in full (the rule text in the shape `project-conventions` asks, the lint configuration, the test, the sentence for the skill, the design change as a paragraph and the modules it creates), and one line saying what stays with a human after it. A recommendation first where two rungs compete. The close: a table of finding, rung, cost, and the ones dropped with why.

## Apply

**On the person's yes, per finding, never as a batch.** A rule goes through `project-conventions`, capture mode. A lint rule and a test go into the repository on a branch, the test red on the tree's existing violations first. A design change is a plan (`write-plan`), never a change made from here. A sentence for a skill in this collection is proposed to the person with the skill named, written on the yes.

## Red flags

| Thought | Reality |
|---|---|
| "This one is obvious, a rule will do" | A rule is read after the code is written. Try the rungs above it first. |
| "Five occurrences, so a lint rule" | The count says how urgent. The criterion says which rung. |
| "The person wrote 'can we', so it is a question, not a finding" | Read the reply. A "done, commit x" answered it as a finding. |
