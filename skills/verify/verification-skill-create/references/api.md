# Harness: an HTTP or gRPC API

**The tool**: the repository's own client or SDK first, else a small script (`fetch`, `grpcurl`); `curl` for one call. Driven as the documented contract says, over the network, with the authentication a real client obtains through the real flow.

**The starting state** through the API itself: the ids a create returns are the ids the next call uses, never read from the database.

**What to observe**: every request and response, secrets redacted; the outcome read back through the API; side effects at their real boundary (the mail sink, the queue, a webhook listener). A 200 with an error in its body is an error.

## The roles of this surface

Written into the role prompt, in the product's terms, each with what it answers for:

- **The client developer**: a contract that reads and behaves as documented, its examples running as written, its errors saying what to fix with the status their kind deserves.
- **Its contract steward**: names, shapes, dates, pagination and errors alike from one endpoint to the next.

## Gotchas

- **Eventual consistency**: a list not yet holding the record is a bounded wait on the read, then a finding.
- **A dry-run flag or sandbox mode**: check what it skips before trusting its name.
