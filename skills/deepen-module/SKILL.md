name: deepen-module
description: Use when a person asks to design a new module's interface or to rework an existing module so that it hides much behind little, in any tier (backend, frontend, test support, tooling), or says a module's callers know too much about it. Produces a module document in aiview, how a caller uses it, its one public entry point as signatures, what stays outside and the gap from today, discussed with the person until agreed. Not for reviewing a whole codebase's design (code-design-review), not for writing the slice that carries the rework out (write-slice) and not for the rework itself.

# Deepen a module

**The goal is to hide accidental complexity**: the codebase knows the module's entry and nothing behind it, as if it were a package that has not been published.

**One `module` document per module, written from the first finding, never in chat.** Through the `aiview` skill: kind `module`, file `YYYY-MM-DD-<module>.module.md`, tags = project + module name, in the plan's group when a plan waits on it. Each stage below writes its sections into it.

## Discover

**For an existing module, discover its actual boundaries before designing.** Its code may be scattered across the codebase. Document its files, its callers and its application dependencies in *Today*. A new module starts at Design.

## Design

**Sections in this order, each marked provisional where an open decision could change it.**

1. **Usage**: the complete code a caller writes to use the module; for a component, its tag with its inputs and outputs. It carries the caller's intent and no accidental complexity: no wiring, ordering, configuration or knowledge of internals.
2. **The entry**: one logical public entry point: a file, a component, a factory or a package entry. All public access goes through it, its surface stays cohesive, and it is written as signatures without bodies.
3. **Outside**: what stays in the project: its data, and the one binding that passes the project's names to the module.
4. **The conditions**, each marked held or broken today:
   - all access to the module goes through the entry
   - the module imports nothing from the application, and receives any collaborator it drives
   - it reads no environment and no global state
   - every project-specific name, path or setting is an option with a working default
   - its tests go through the entry only, and a boundary test enforces these conditions
5. **The gap**: what changes from *Today* to reach the design: exports, imports, and every caller. Changing the callers is part of the work. A large gap is drawn, who depends on whom before and after, through the `write-diagrams` skill.
6. **The open decisions**, numbered, each with its options and a recommendation.

## Discuss

**Resolve the open decisions with the `interview` skill**, writing each answer into the section it changes. Challenge every export: what no caller clearly needs stays inside.

## Agree

**The document is agreed when the list is empty and the person says so.** The date goes in its header, and the entry is frozen: a later change to it is a new decision.

## Implement

**The rework is a slice, and its document quotes the agreed entry word for word.**

## Red flags

| Thought | Reality |
|---|---|
| "I'll add an option for that" | An option nobody passes is surface. |
| "Callers may need this helper" | Name the caller. One that exists only in the tests is served by the entry. |
